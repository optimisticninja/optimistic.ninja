Hello, I am J - because I strongly back protection of data and your identity in public spaces online, this is all you will know me as. I am a very active developer and do security research as a hobby. If you like what I have to offer, ping my abuse or admin address.

## Ping me!

If you have any questions, comments, vulnerabilities, write-up requests - please don't hesitate to [send me an email](mailto:admin@optimistic.ninja).
