I have opened registration for my XMPP server. XMPP is the protocol behind Facebook's chat, previously GChat and quite a few others. If you get a message that registration is full, send me an email at admin@optimistic.ninja - the registration number is small to see initial interest.

[Pidgin](https://pidgin.im) is a great client for XMPP if you use Windows or Linux, [Adium](https://adium.im) for OS X (or macOS - :eyeroll:), [Conversations](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.siacs.conversations) on Android and you hipster iOS kids can hunt down something for that...

I highly recommend using the [Off-The-Record messaging plugin](https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/index.php#downloads) for added security and person verification. Enable it in Tools->Plugins for Pidgin and generate your key. Instruct your friends to do the same if they are on a PC. Otherwise, Conversations and Adium support it out of the box.

## Pidgin Setup

!!! Make sure to check the box at the bottom !!!

## Conversations Setup

You will need to go into settings and change a few things first.

1. Enable expert settings.

2. Enable extended connection settings.
