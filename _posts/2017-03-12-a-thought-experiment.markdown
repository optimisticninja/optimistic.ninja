Albert Einstein revealed a tiny equation that defined the rules of the world from the big bang on. This equation beckons a post because a coworker recently mentioned string theory and m-theory... goodbye sleep. These theories were eye-opening, beautiful and capable of revealing the connections of everything in the universes… 

Call me a hippy, call it looking for god, there are great answers in the connections of anything if you pay close enough attention. Funny enough, this pattern was revealed to me through computers and continues to show itself every single day with everything I experience.

Let’s relate this to the internet – for you smartypants that know how the internet actually works, I’m leaving those details out for impact. At its highest level, the internet is a series of connected computers or nodes, all mildly different - some running Windows, some running macOS, some serving content to clients, some connecting through several computers to create their content. That is all what makes a node something specific, its differences – throw them away, we don’t care about node specifics. 

We care about the behavior, the consciousness of the network. What does every node have in common and do? What do you see when you look at the internet? Do you see natural selection? Do you see mating of ideas to create new ideas? Do you see the evolution?

More than ever, I think it is important for people to view the world in this new way and try to see anything and everything as a node. Find the connections, grow them. Learning about genetic algorithms/AI has helped me find some of the answers I’ve been looking for my whole life. A genetic algorithm works on an encoding. This encoding is what makes up the properties of this individual node (or chromosome in this case), it is its uniqueness. Through an iterative process of starting with a small population and breeding based on a fitness level of other nodes, new chromosomes are born – evolution can even be accelerated/decelerated. Generations build their way out to segregate properties and evolve from them into fitter chromosomes. Now, back to string theory – it takes us before the big bang and tells us we are part of a multiverse. According to this theory, two universes can join creating a new universe. It is thought that the collision or separation of these two universes is the big bang. Sound familiar? Two living things joining together to make new life, the new life containing properties of both its parents only to perpetuate the cycle. Two countries clashing only to build up from the rubble of what happened – creating new allies, enemies and divisions between people, diversifying as new connections are made.
