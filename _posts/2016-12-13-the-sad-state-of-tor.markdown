There is a very quiet [struggle](https://www.i2coalition.com/rule-41-expands-government-hacking-authority/) going on in the online world. A tool that came from the military/government is now being used against people all over the world as a "marker of wrongdoing". It is even being used as a weapon against the people who use it. VPN services are also under such scrutiny...

It is a scary place to be doing this, but I thought I would take my stance publicly. Although Tor (like most things) has the potential to be used for evil - it also has an incredibly important role in protecting people that are critical to the function of a nation. And no... I do not mean the agencies, politicians and those who can pay for power. I mean the inhabitants of the countries; the journalists, the people the system is supposed to rely on as adversarial guidelines and to expose wrongdoings.

Censorship of media, censorship of anonymity tools, and censorship of [physical products](https://www.wired.com/2015/07/online-anonymity-project-proxyham-mysteriously-vanishes/) is something that can't be allowed to happen for the sake of (even if only possibly) reserving tools like it to those in power. Your 4th and 5th ammendment rights should not have to face scrutiny because you are interested in a protocol.
